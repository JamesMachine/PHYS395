QUESTION 1

Simply integrated directly using initial guesses and wrong eigenvalues. The solutions diverge as expected!

QUESTION 2

Used bisection method to find eigenvalues and plotted solutions and solutions^2. I noted that the solutions seems to grow outwards at higher orders which seems wrong. Not sure about this.

QUESTION 3

Again used bisection method, though this time I don't think the eigenvalues are quite accurate, as the plots diverge. I could not figure out how to fix this.

QUESTION 4

Modified rayleigh code as suggested. eigenstuff came out in funky order, so had to sort them. Also even eigenfunction were negative for some reason, so just brute forced it.

QUESTION 5

Same as question 4, only changed the potential and everything worked perfectly.
