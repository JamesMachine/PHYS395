Assignment 3

Run the program with this command:
time bash runme.sh


Note that I set n=5 because fortran starts index from 1 and add the constant (n=1,2,3,4,5; # of coefficients)
All the output results are shown in the terminal and the graphs are plotted into pdf in one file!
To see the pdf properly, make pdf automatic so that you can see the pdf within the page.
