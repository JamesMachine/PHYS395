Assignment 4:

Running instruction for shorter program:
time bash runme.sh

Running instruction for MUCH LONGER program for Q3 only:
time bash runme_longrun.sh

runme.sh took me 5min to run. runme_longrun.sh took me 108min to run! They have different time step and different integration length of time. For the longer program, there are more pixels defined.

Output under ./output folder:
Results

data.fit --> used for plotting and can get data.png through plotfit.py

Output under ./output_longrun folder:
data.png
data.fit --> used for plotting and can get data.png through plotfit_longrun.py
