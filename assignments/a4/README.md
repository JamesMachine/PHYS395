Assignment 4 (Re-submitted based on the peer review):

Running instruction for shorter program (It took me 5hours of running...):
time bash runme.sh

in runme.sh,
doanimate=false --> not doing animation will run faster
dofractal=false --> not doing phase scan will run much much faster

Under ./output folder, the program will save results into output folder (Don't delete output folder).
Under ./final_output folder, all the final results are stored in this folder.
