Assignment 1

Description:
From q1.90 to q5.f90, the code was constructively programmed. Hence, the q5.f90 and
q5_2.f90 are the latest version of code that contains everthing.(Because I couldn't implement module...)
If you need to read the code, just read q5.f90 that contains everything functions.

Hence, q1.f90 only shows the Gaussian elimination solution in question 1. --> output result in the terminal.
q4.f90 shows from question 2 to question 4 for 10 terms. -->output 'q4_output_10terms.pdf'
q4_2.f90 shows from question 2 to question 4 for 100 terms.  -->output 'q4_output_100terms.pdf'
q5.f90 repeat q4.f90 for different xi for 10 terms. --> output 'q5_output_10terms.pdf'
q5_2.f90 repeat q4.f90 for different xi for 100 terms. --> output 'q5_output_100terms.pdf'

Difference between q4 and q5 is using populateArray2() function in q5 instead of populateArray() function used in q4.

Note q3.f90 shows the solution for question3 for 100 terms only. --> output 'q3_output.pdf'
